- support embedded atomic types by including a second (and third and fourth) 
package type_prefix::complex_type::element_name element package.
Allow unlimited depth (though this is rather wicked).
- fixup generated pod so it looks nice in SOAP::WSDL::Definitions.
- remove benchmarks from tests. Create benchmark/ directory and store benchmarks in.
- add tests for SOAP::WSDL::Definitions::create 
   - test for correct creation
   - test against web service (fullerdata.com?)
- Improve docs
   - Partially DONE
- Remove SOAP::Lite dependency - for now, just support HTTP(s) via LWP::UserAgent.
   - Partially DONE. SOAP::WSDL still uses SOAP::Schema
- write inheritance Test for all XSD::Typelib::Builtin::* classes
- Check & probably fix simpleType support. 
The WS at http://www.webservicex.net/genericbarcode.asmx?wsdl should make up a good example for simpleType 
definitions.
- add default Fault11 typemap to generated typemaps
  - DONE
- SOAP::WSDL::Definitions::create creates bad interface docs. Fix it.
   - DONE
- update all Builtin Types to new constructor BEGIN block (Class::Std unfortunately is way slow)
   - DONE.
- Remove useless (but on CPAN annoying) doc from Builtin::* classes
   - DONE
- add example WS scripts
   - DONE.
- SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string does not unescape XML builtin entities on get_value()
   - WONTFIX. 
   Entities are unescaped by XML parser. 
   If you want the plain value, you have to use get_value, as XML conversion is overloaded on stringification.
- Make callin WS easier: implent WS-I-based SOAP::WSDL::Client::WSI
   - WONTFIX - SOAP::WSDL::Base should behave equal
- add capability to create request objects based on input part definitions to SOAP::WSDL::Client::Base
   - DONE.

- remove benchmarks from tests. Create benchmark/ directory and store benchmarks in.
- SOAP::WSDL::Definitions::create creates bad interface docs. Fix it.
- add tests for SOAP::WSDL::Definitions::create 
   - test for correct creation
   - test against web service (fullerdata.com?)
- Improve docs
- Remove SOAP::Lite dependency - for now, just support HTTP(s) via LWP::UserAgent.
- write inheritance Test for all XSD::Typelib::Builtin::* classes
- Check & probably fix simpleType support. 
The WS at http://www.webservicex.net/genericbarcode.asmx?wsdl should make up a good example for simpleType 
definitions.
- update all Builtin Types to new constructor BEGIN block (Class::Std unfortunately is way slow)
   - DONE.
- Remove useless (but on CPAN annoying) doc from Builtin::* classes
   - DONE
- add example WS scripts
   - DONE.
- SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string does not unescape XML builtin entities on get_value()
   - WONTFIX. 
   Entities are unescaped by XML parser. 
   If you want the plain value, you have to use get_value, as XML conversion is overloaded on stringification.
- Make callin WS easier: implent WS-I-based SOAP::WSDL::Client::WSI
   - WONTFIX - SOAP::WSDL::Base should behave equal
- add capability to create request objects based on input part definitions to SOAP::WSDL::Client::Base
   - DONE.

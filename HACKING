Development of SOAP::WSDL takes place on sourceforge.net.

There's a svn repository available at 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/soap-wsdl

Engagement in the further development of this module is highly encouraged - 
many people have already contributed, and many more probably will.

I'm sometimes a bit slow in answering e-mails or merging in changes - 
so if you feel your changes are urgent, please set up a sourceforge account 
and ask me for commit permissions on the repository - I will happily accept 
you as co-author.

The (my) current roadmap for SOAP::WSDL is:

1.2*: Bugfixes and support for more XSD variants

1.3: Bindings support

Development of the 1.* tree has stopped - I won't get past 1.2x anymore...

2.*: WSDL -> Perl Class factory with offline WSDL processing

Release notes for SOAP::WSDL 2.00_11
-------

I'm happy to present a new pre-release version of SOAP::WSDL.

The following features were added (the numbers in brackets are the tracker IDs
from https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=111978&atid=660924):

  * [1767963] Transport plugins via SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport.
    SOAP::WSDL uses SOAP::Lite's tranport modules as default, with a 
    lightweight HTTP(S) transport plugin as fallback.
    Custom transport modules can be registered via 
    SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport.

  * [ 1772730 ] Serializer plugins via SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer 
    The default serializer for SOAP1.1 is SOAP::WSDL::Serializer::SOAP11.
    Custom serializers classes can be registered via 
    SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer or set via SOAP::Lite's set_serializer 
    method.

The following bugs have been fixed (the numbers in brackets are the tracker IDs
from https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=111978&atid=660921):

   * [ 1764854 ] Port WSDL parser to expat and remove XML::LibXML dependency
     SOAP::WSDL now requires only XML::Parser to be installed.
     XML::LibXML is not required any more, though XML::LibXML based modules still 
     exist.

The following uncategorized improvements have been made

   * The number of dependencies has been reduced. SOAP::WSDL no longer requires the 
     following modules to be installed:
        - XML::SAX::Base
        - XML::SAX::ParserFactory
        - Pod::Simple::Text

   * The missing prerequisite Template has been added.
   * Documentation has been improved.

      strings into XML date strings

      of UTF8 documentation from WSDL

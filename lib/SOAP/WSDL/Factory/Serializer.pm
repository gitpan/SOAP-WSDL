=head1 NAME

SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer - factory for retrieving serializer objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # from SOAP::WSDL::Client:
 $serializer = SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer->get_serializer({
     soap_version => $soap_version,
 });

 # in serializer class:
 package MyWickedSerializer;
 use SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer;
 
 # u don't know the SOAP 1.2 recommendation? poor boy...
 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer->register( '1.2' , __PACKAGE__ );
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer serves as factory for retrieving 
serializer objects for SOAP::WSDL.

The actual work is done by specific serializer classes.

SOAP::WSDL::Serializer tries to load one of the following classes:

 a) the class registered for the scheme via register()

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register

 SOAP::WSDL::Serializer->register('1.1', 'MyWickedSerializer');

Globally registers a class for use as serializer class.

=head2 get_serializer

Returns an object of the serializer class for this endpoint.

=head1 WRITING YOUR OWN SERIALIZER CLASS

Serializer classes may register with SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer.

Serializer objects may also be passed directly to SOAP::WSDL::Client 
by using the set_serializer method. Note that serializers objects set 
via SOAP::WSDL::Client's set_serializer method are discarded when the 
SOAP version is changed via set_soap_version.

Registering a serializer class with SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer 
is done by executing the following code where $version is the 
SOAP version the class should be used for, and $class is the class
name.

 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Serializer->register( $version, $class);

To auto-register your transport class on loading, execute register() 
in your tranport class (see L<SYNOPSIS|SYNOPSIS> above).

Serializer modules must be named equal to the serializer 
class they contain. There can only be one serializer class per 
serializer module.

Serializer class must implement the following methods:

=over 

=item * new

Constructor.

=item * serialize

Serializes data to XML. The following named parameters are passed to 
the serialize method in a anonymous hash ref:

 {
   method => $operation_name,
   header => $header_data,
   body => $body_data,
 }

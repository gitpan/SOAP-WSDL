=head2 Features different from SOAP::Lite

SOAP::WSDL does not aim to be a complete replacement for SOAP::Lite - the
SOAP::Lite module has it's strengths and weaknesses and SOAP::WSDL is
designed as a cure for the weakness of little WSDL support - nothing more,
nothing less.

Nonetheless SOAP::WSDL mimics part of SOAP::Lite's API and behaviour,
so SOAP::Lite users can switch without looking up every method call in the
documentation.

A few things are quite differentl from SOAP::Lite, though:

=head3 SOAP request data

SOAP request data may either be given as message object, or as hash ref (in
which case it will automatically be encoded into a message object).

=head3 Return values

The result from call() is not a SOAP::SOM object, but a message object.

Message objects' classes may be generated from WSDL definitions automatically
- see SOAP::WSDL::Generator::Typelib on how to generate your own WSDL based
message class library.

=head3 Fault handling

SOAP::WSDL::Client returns a fault object on errors, even on transport layer
errors.

The fault object is a SOAP1.1 fault object of the following
C<SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11>.

SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11 objects are false in boolean context, so
you can just do something like

 my $result = $soap->call($method, $data);

 if ($result) {
    # handle result
 }
 else {
    die $result->faultstring();
 }

=head3 outputxml

SOAP::Lite returns only the content of the SOAP body when outputxml is set
to true. SOAP::WSDL::Client returns the complete XML response.

=head3 Auto-Dispatching

SOAP::WSDL::Client does B<does not> support auto-dispatching.

This is on purpose: You may easily create interface classes by using
SOAP::WSDL::Client and implementing something like

 sub mySoapMethod {
     my $self = shift;
     $soap_wsdl_client->call( mySoapMethod, @_);
 }

You may even do this in a class factory - SOAP::WSDL provides the methods
for generating such interfaces.

=head2 web service

Web services are RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces accessible via 
some internet protocol, typically via HTTP(S). 

=head2 SOAP

SOAP (the Simple Object Access Protocol) is a specification for 
defining RPC interfaces, including (but not neccessarily limited to) 
web services. 

While one of the constituting aspects of a web service is its 
reachability via some internet protocol, you might as well define 
SOAP services accessible via postcards.

Despite it's name, SOAP has nothing more to do with objects than 
cars have with pets - SOAP messages may, but not neccessarily do 
carry objects, very much like your car may, but does not need to 
carry your pet.

=head2 WSDL

WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) is a XML-based markup language 
for defining web service interfaces. 

=head2 WS-I

WS-I (Web Service Interoperability) is a industry consortium dedicated 
to finding interoperability rules for web services.

SOAP::WSDL aims to be a WS-I compliant SOAP client.
